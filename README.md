# Tag strings

This repo contains an issue tracker, examples, and early work related to PEP 999: Tag Strings.


# Naming

"Tag strings" or "tag-strings"? Hyphenating directly parallels f-strings, and it could be possibly easier to search for. On the other hand, "tag strings" might read better. Let's play with this spelling to see what works best.


# Origins

This project is directly inspired by the JavaScript's support of [tagged template literals](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals).

Related work in Python includes
- [Flufl i18n substitutions](https://flufli18n.readthedocs.io/en/stable/using.html#substitutions-and-placeholders)
- [Tagged library](https://github.com/jviide/tagged)
- [PEP 501: Interpolation templates](https://peps.python.org/pep-0501/)
- [Earlier work by the same authors](https://github.com/jimbaker/fl-string-pep)
